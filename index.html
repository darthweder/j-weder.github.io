<p> I am working on protoplanetary disc evolution and its influence on planetary populations. We try to combine different models for disc limited gas accretion, trying to get a better understanding of the planetary mass function. Finally we would like to make predictions of the mass function for observations by the ROMAN space telescope. </p>
